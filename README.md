# Project-Predicting-Bike-Sharing
Build and train own Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

## Introduction
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

Process of project contains:
- Implement Forward Pass
- Implement Backward Pass 
- Set proper Hyperparameters

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## The result of project shown below:

Waiting for results...Done!
